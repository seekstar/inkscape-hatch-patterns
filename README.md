# Inkscape Hatch Patterns

This is a mirror of HenJan van der Pol's excellent [Patterns for Mechanical Drawings in Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/~henkjan_nl/%E2%98%85patterns-for-mechanical-drawings-in-inkscape). The original ZIP package was missing the Defs.txt which is included here. It can also be generated by running the python script: ```python3 HatchPatterns.py```

All credit for this goes to [HenkJan van der Pol](https://inkscape.org/~henkjan_nl/) for this very helpful pattern library.

## How to use

### Single Pattern Usage
- Read HenkJan van der Pol's [instructions (PDF)](Patterns%20for%20mechanical%20drawings%20in%20Inkscape.pdf) on how to manually copy patterns via copying and pasting object properties.

### Add to pattern fill dropdown

Copy [`HatchPatterns.svg`](HatchPatterns.svg) into your Inkscape paint patterns folder:

#### MacOS
```shell
cp HatchPatterns.svg /Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/share/inkscape/paint/
```

#### Windows
```shell
copy HatchPatterns.svg "C:\Program Files\Inkscape\share\inkscape\paint\"
```

Relaunching Inkscape. The patterns will always be available from the pattern fill dropdown:

### Add as a paint server (this also adds to the pattern fill dropdown)

This method installs the pattern as a paint server in your Inkscape user config directory rather than the app directory (which could get overwritten). You can find  Inkscape user config directory path by going to Inkscape > Settings > System and look for the User Config path.

#### Linux
```shell
cp paint/HatchPatterns.svg ~/.config/inkscape/paint/
```

#### MacOS
```shell
cp paint/HatchPatterns.svg ~/Library/Application Support/org.inkscape.Inkscape/config/inkscape/paint/
```

Then reload inkscape. The hatches are available from the Object > Paint Servers menu under the name "Hatch Patterns" (as from the <title> in `paint/HatchPatterns.svg`). They should also show up under the Fill/Stroke menu.

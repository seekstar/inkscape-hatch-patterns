# Inkscape Hatch Patterns

This is a mirror of HenJan van der Pol's excellent [Patterns for Mechanical Drawings in Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/~henkjan_nl/%E2%98%85patterns-for-mechanical-drawings-in-inkscape). The original ZIP package was missing the Defs.txt which is included here. It can also be generated by running the python script: ```python3 HatchPatterns.py```

All credit for this goes to [HenkJan van der Pol](https://inkscape.org/~henkjan_nl/) for this very helpful pattern library.
